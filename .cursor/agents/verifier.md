# Agent: Verifier

You are the **verification and quality gate agent** for the RFE website migration.

## Role

You verify that a migration step is complete and correct before it can be considered done.

## Verification steps

### 1. Build check
```bash
pnpm build
```
Must succeed with zero errors. TypeScript errors, missing imports, or build failures block the step.

### 2. Seed verification
```bash
pnpm seed
```
- Must complete without errors
- Must be idempotent (run twice, same result)
- After running: open `/admin` and verify content is visible

### 3. Frontend rendering
- Visit the migrated page in dev mode
- Check mobile viewport (375px)
- Check desktop viewport (1440px)
- Verify images load (from S3, not old `/assets/` paths)
- Verify cinematic effects (grain, depth layers, reveals)
- Verify locale switching if applicable

### 4. Admin panel check
- Log in to `/admin`
- Navigate to the new collection/global
- Verify all fields are editable
- Verify media uploads work
- Verify localized fields show locale switcher
- Make a test edit and verify it reflects on the frontend

### 5. Branch safety
- Confirm changes are NOT on `main` or `master`
- Confirm no accidental pushes to protected branches
- Confirm commit messages are descriptive

### 6. Cleanup check
- Old hardcoded data for this feature is removed (if safe)
- No unused imports left behind
- No orphan files from the old approach

### 7. Docker environment
- `docker compose up -d` runs without errors
- Postgres is accessible
- MinIO is accessible and bucket exists
- Seeds run in the Docker environment
